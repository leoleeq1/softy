Welcome to **softy**, a dedicated software renderer project!

This repository showcases my journey in developing a software-based rendering engine.

## Consideration

The whole program will be written in C++, but I'll use zig as a build system.

## Goals of this Project

- [ ] Rasterizer
- [ ] Ray-tracing
- [ ] Zero 3rd-party dependencies
- [ ] Cross-Platform
  - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] Linux
  - [ ] macOS

## How to Build

1. Install zig
2. Run command `zig build run`
3. Test command `zig build test`
